# ProcessorsOfPower
The POP (Processors of Power) project sets the goal to create a series of simple RISC processor architectures.

The PoP project will include a number of processor designs, starting the the bare minimums and working towards more modern and practical systems. It is also part of the project to design and create a usable toolchain for the architectures, starting with an assembly language, an assembler, a linker, a virtual machine, and if possible, a standard C or Rust compiler compiler.

We have at the moment **0** finished designs.

Our latest design is **N/A**.

Te current design we are working on is the **POP81** :
* An 8 bit processor
* With 16 bit address bus
* Just the bare minimums: no pipeline, no caching, nothing but an ALU and a control unit.
* Toolchain will include:
  * an assemlber
  * A virtual machine
  * possibly a minimalistic C compiler (C-- :D)
